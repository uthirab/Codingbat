'''This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index
i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be
[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was 
[3, 2, 1], the expected output would be 
[2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
'''
y=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x=[3, 2, 1]
result=1
z=[1 for i in range(len(x))]
for i in range(len(x)):
    for j in range(len(x)):
        if i==j:
            continue
        else:   
            z[i]=x[j]*z[i]
print(z)
